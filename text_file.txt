The GUR reports that the aggregate plant in #Vovchansk has been captured

Russia had seized the building in May during its offensive on Kharkiv.

At the end of June, however, it was reported that the Ukrainian forces had advanced into the city as a result of successful counterattacks and had taken all entrances to the plant under fire. This made it considerably more difficult to supply the Russians at the plant with food and ammunition.

Fighters from the "Russian Volunteer Corps" and Belarusian volunteers were also involved in the attack on the plant.
